                Now that you're here ðŸ™‚ <br/>
                Lets talk about what I've worked on. <br/>
                I'm gonna go deadpool and break the fourth wall. <br/>
                You're looking at my first project. <br/>
                It's super minimalistic. 
                There's no toolbars only text and interesting buttons <br/>
                I built this project using React.js. <br/>
                I learned React as a Bootcamper with Bits of Good <br/>
                I learned the ins and outs of Front-End Web Development <br/>
                Though I could've built a static website using really any framerwork <br/>
                I wanted to really flex my knowledge of <a href="https://reactjs.org/"> React </a>
                <br/>
            </p>
