                Welcome to my second project <br/>
                So the current cool kitchen gadget is Air Fryers. <br/>
                And with any cool thing they are expensive <br/>
                I could just sit there and watch the price everday <br/>
                But whats even better is a python webscraper <br/>
                a webscraper that monitors the price and lets me <br/>
                when the price drops. This is my current <br/>
                summer project. 
            </p>
